NativeScript mobile framework installation.

Note: NativeScript CLI uses Xcode to build iOS apps, which is only available on the MacOS operating system. To build iOS apps from Linux, use NativeScript Sidekick which includes a service to provide iOS and Android builds in the cloud.


1. Install latest NodeJs (current 8.11.3 LTS)
---------------------------------------------

I strongly recommend using a NodeJs version manager like nvm, there are versions for Windows/Mac/Linxu.
To install nvm see:

quicknotes/technology/linux/services/nvm.txt

$ cd
$ nvm install 8.11
Now using node v8.11.3 (npm v5.6.0)
Creating default alias: default -> 8.11 (-> v8.11.3)


2. Install NativeScript CLI
---------------------------

The NativeScript CLI tool uses the tns command for all operations.

Nativescript printed warning messages when first installed. When I installed NodeJs using nvm, it installed npm version 5.6.0, this is older and we need to have the latest npm to install NativeScript without warnings.

$ npm install npm@latest -g
+ npm@6.1.0

$ npm install -g nativescript
+ nativescript@4.1.1
added 656 packages from 1180 contributors in 6.345s

Confirm the installed versions:

$ node --version
v8.11.3

$ npm --version
6.1.0

$ tns --version
4.1.1


3. Create first app
-------------------

The cli command tns create, will scaffold a new application. See wiki for full command usage:
https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/wiki/Using-the-%60tns-create%60-command
Android installation needs to be completed before adding the Android platform.

$ cd
$ mkdir nativescript
$ cd nativescript

$ tns create recorder --ng
...
Adding 'es6' lib to tsconfig.json...
Adding 'dom' lib to tsconfig.json...
Adding 'es2015.iterable' lib to tsconfig.json...
Adding tns-core-modules path mappings lib to tsconfig.json...
Project already targets TypeScript ~2.7.2
added 16 packages from 6 contributors in 3.072s
Project recorder was successfully created.

Now you can navigate to your project with $ cd recorder
After that you can run it on device/emulator by executing $ tns run <platform>

** need to have Android SDK installed first

$ tns run
