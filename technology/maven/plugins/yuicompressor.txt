Maven plugin for compiling and aggregating Javascript using Yahoo's yuicompressor library.

This plugin will compress Javascript files and generate compressed files that have the -min.js file extension.If the aggregation targets are not specified the plugin will simply compress all Javascript files it finds. It is important to exclude any library files and files that are not needed for execution. Each aggregation section specifies an output file and the collection of source files.
