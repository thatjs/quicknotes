$ git clone

Configure a RHEL Linux machine to push commits to Github.

$ git --version
git version 1.7.7.3

$ cd /pub/git/thatjs

$ git clone git://github.com/thatjs/quicknotes.git

Generate SSH keys:
------------------

$ cd ~/.ssh

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "{your}@{email}.{com}"

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/thatjs/.ssh/id_rsa): {your key}_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): ***********
Enter same passphrase again: ***********
Your identification has been saved in {your key}_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in {your key}_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
68:ca:22:2d:c6:f4:42:8c:5c:3b:2c:cd:36:84:25:3c {your}@{email}.{com}

$ ls
known_hosts  thatjs_rsa  thatjs_rsa.pub


Installing private key:
-----------------------

After the key is generated it needs to be registered on each login. To automate this, you can add an entry to the end of your .bashrc file. If this key is used occasionally, you can simple execute the ssh-add command when needed in the xterm.

$ cd ~

$ vi .bashrc

# ssh-add identities
ssh-add ~thatjs/.ssh/thatjs_rsa

:wq


Install the public key on Github.com:
-------------------------------------

Login Github -> settings -> ssh keys
  name: {your key}
  key: paste contents of thatjs_rsa.pub into textarea -> save

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/thatjs_rsa  // if not added to .bashrc yet
Identity added: /home/thatjs/.ssh/thatjs_rsa (/home/thatjs/.ssh/thatjs_rsa)


Verify new key:
---------------

$ ssh -T git@github.com
Hi thatjs! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.


Complete git project configuration:
-----------------------------------

$ cd /pub/git/quicknotes

$ git config --list
...
remote.origin.url=git://github.com/thatjs/quicknotes.git

You need to change the url for this project to use the ssh version. Executing the following will return an error because remote.origin.url is already defined. Either edit .git/config manually or just remove the above line and type the command again.

$ git config remote.origin.url ssh://git@github.com/thatjs/quicknotes.git

$ git config --list
...
remote.origin.url=ssh://git@github.com/thatjs/quicknotes.git


Test your project:
------------------

$ git pull
