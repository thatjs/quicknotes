Scanning from an HP multi purpose printer on CentOS7.

After building my CentOS7 system a few years ago, I was delighted to find out that configuring print drivers from
HP has become simple and intuitive. No hassles and it just works. Recently, I needed to scan a document, and
as usual did a quick web search. Xsane was very straight forward to install and I was able to scan equally quickly.

1. Install HP and Xsane
-----------------------

$ su

# yum install hplip hplip-gui xsane sane


2. Configure the Scanner
------------------------

# hp-setup

Accept the default driver for your HP printer. In my case I have a network printer. Enter the IP address for the printer
and it will populate the device in the window.

Click Add Printer button

# exit


3. Start scanner
----------------

$ xsane

Add the document to the flatbed scanner.

Click the Acquire Preview button

Adjust the capture boundaries.

Select the output file type, filename and save location.

Click the Scan button.


4. Verify the scanned document in the output file
-------------------------------------------------

Opened my scanned document in pdf format. Done.
