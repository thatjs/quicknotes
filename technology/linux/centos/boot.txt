Centos7 Boot Information

CentOS 7 comes setup to display a splash screen with a spinner while booting. Us older folk may prefer to watch the individual services start up, especially when one service inconsistently takes a lot of time. You can always press 'esc' while booting to see the classic list of services as they are starting.
