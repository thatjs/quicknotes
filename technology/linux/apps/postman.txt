Postman - Open source api design and development tool.

As we are installing on Centos7, I prefer to install tools in /usr/local/src which I have made writable by my local user, however any directory will work.


1. Download tar file
--------------------
https://dl.pstmn.io/download/latest/linux64


2. Expand tar file
------------------

$ cd /usr/local/src
$ mkdir postman
$ cd postman

$ tar -zxvf ~user/Downloads/Postman-linux-x64-7.14.0.tar.gz
$ ls -la
drwxr-xr-x. 4 user user 4096 Dec 18 00:48 app
drwxr-xr-x. 2 user user   21 Dec 27 16:27 Postman


3. Create a desktop file to launch Postman
------------------------------------------

vi ~user/.local/share/applications/Postman.desktop

[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Postman
Exec=/usr/local/src/postman/app/Postman %U
Icon=/usr/local/src/postman/app/resources/app/assets/icon.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Development;

:wq

Desktop Icon will appear in the Programming folder


4. Launch application
---------------------
Application -> Programming -> Postman

Create Account:

Email: {email@domain.ext}
Username: {username}
Password {passwd}

!! success !!
