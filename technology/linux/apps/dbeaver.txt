DBeaver - Open source database administration utility and editor.

1. Install RPM
--------------

$ cd
$ su
# rpm -ivh dbeaver-ce-5.1.1-stable.x86_64.rpm

2. Launch DBeaver app
---------------------

$ dbeaver &

Applications -> Programming => DBeaver Community


3. Setup Database Connections
-----------------------------

Typically I will create two users, the root user for creating databases and a regular user to interact with a
database.

Database Navigator -> (+) Add Connection

  Select Database Type: Mysql. Note that DBeaver hoists selected databases to the top of the list.
  General:
    Server Host: localhost
    Port: 3306
    Database:
    User name: root
    Password: {rootPassword}

  If you do not have the necessary drivers installed, the connection wizard will prompt you to install them.

  Finish


4. Open SQL Editor
------------------

Right click the connection name -> SQL Editor

create database {dbName};
grant all on {dbName}.* to '{user}'@'localhost';


5. Database Navigator
---------------------

There seems to be a bug in DBeaver, when using the MySQL driver: mysql-connector-java:RELEASE[8.0.11]. The Database
Navigator will not display the database where I have granted my developer {user}, rights to this database. All database
queries execute for this user, however the database does not populate in this user's connection view.

Installed MySQL Database: 5.6.42
Installed DBeaver MySQL Driver 8.0.11

Even with this minor issue, using DBeaver has greatly improved managing multiple databases for development.
